- To run search engine: compile searchEngine.java, followed by input file. 
	+ Follow instructions to perform any action
	+ After selecting an action, press ENTER to perform the action or put in additional inputs. Each input must align with selected categories and must be on a separate line. 
		For example: 	f n d
						Lafayette Lehigh Swimming
						11/11/2017 
	+ User can put in at most 2 dates, representing a period of time. These two dates are separated by a SPACE. 
	+ Organizers are separated by comma and space (, ) 

-  To run the experiment, the user can compile Experiment.java, followed by inputs in the following order: 
							seed1 name type org startDate endDate location.
	+ Inputs such as name, type, org, ... can be taken from the smallest file of each seed. 
	+ This command will run 10 input files of various sizes, generated by the same seed.
	+ "seed1" can be replaced by "seed2" or "seed3" to run files generated by other seeds. 
	+ Outputs are put in the following order: 
			search time by name 
			search time by type 
			search time by organization
			search time by dates 
			search time by location 
			writing time to files 

- Below are the three arguments I used to run my experiment: 
seed1 name_1934721288 art org_2096618102 8/3/1989 1/6/1989 location_1535074172

seed2 name_325576153 art org_869703161 6/3/2009 30/4/2009 location_1477230937

seed3 name_184598687 art org_25496047 29/5/2007 29/5/2007 location_995125906
